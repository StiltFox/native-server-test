/*
* This is a deconstructor. Like a constructor it has no return type. In C++ we
* are responsible for managing our own memory. This means that there may be actions
* an object wants to take before being removed from the heap/stack. The deconstructor
* gets called under the following conditions:
* 1) the object was on the stack and goes out of scope.
* 2) delete is called on the object and the object is on the heap.
*
* A note about the heap and the stack:
* Stack memory and Heap memory both represent addresses in RAM memory that our program
* owns. However there is a critical difference between the two. Stack memory is objects
* and data that the program knows about. ie: a static list, a constant, a function
* variable. Stack memory is dealt with by the compiler and there is nothing  we need to
* do about it as programmers.
*
* Heap memory on the other hand represents unplanned or dynamic memory usage. Every time
* we call the new key word it allocates memory to the heap. In this instance you can think
* of RAM memory as a restaurant, and us allocating memory like reserving a seat. If you 
* reserve a seat, new guests wont be able to use it. The operating system will rope off
* that memory until you tell it you're done with it. You can let the operating system
* know that you're done using this memory by calling the delete operator on the pointer.
* when we delete memory we're calling the restaurant to tell them we're done with our
* reservation. Other customers can now use this table. If we fail to call and cancel,
* eventually the restaurant will fill up with empty seats, and no new customers can
* be served. This is called a memory leak. Always be sure to delete your allocated
* memory.
